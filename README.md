# RPi Ad-Hoc
These scripts come in handy for creating an Ad-Hoc network over wifi with any ubuntu pc or raspberry pi.
An Ad-Hoc network is decentralised and does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure.
I made these scripts so I could automatize this setup and use the rpi as the brain of teleoperated robots, without needing routers, antennas, or other hardware at all.
I used it in this project and could be useful for swarm robots or sensors clouds since each device perform as a node, fowarding data throught himself if needed.
